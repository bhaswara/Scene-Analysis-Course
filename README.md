# Scene-Analysis-Course
This project contains the code for the final assignment of 2D and 3D Scene Analysis Course at the University of Twente. The tasks were about creating a Tello drone which can detect people and doors, track a moving person, do a floor segmentation, and reconstruct a structure of a scene from series of 2D images. The video result from the drone itself can be seen below
